# Housing Price Prediction Project

## Overview : 
This project aims to predict housing prices based on various features using data analysis and machine learning techniques.
The code provided here showcases a comprehensive pipeline for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and evaluation.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates housing prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant factors.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about housing attributes such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, sale prices, and more.

## Methodology

  *Data Preparation*: The dataset is loaded, missing values are identified and handled, and features are prepared for analysis.


   *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Relationships between variables are explored through correlation analysis and visualizations like heatmaps and pair plots. Outliers are detected and managed, and feature engineering as well.


  *Model Development*: Various regression models including Ridge Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and Linear Regression are trained on the data. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

  *Model Evaluation*: Models are evaluated using the R-squared metric, and their performances are compared to identify the best-performing model for predicting housing prices.


  *Feature Importance*: Significant predictors for housing prices are identified using coefficients from the Ridge Regression model.


  *Data Scaling and Encoding*: Numerical features are standardized, and categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding for model consumption.


  *Visualization*: Visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and pairplots are generated to understand data distributions and relationships among variables.


 *Iterative Model Improvement*: Models are iteratively tested and refined by adjusting hyperparameters and evaluating their performance on test data.
